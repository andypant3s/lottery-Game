# lottery-Game-with-gamemodes
Wrote this game with the help of some friends (Felipe and Bernardo, thanks a lot for the help). Couldn't do it without you). It asks you for the gamemode you want to play and starts looping the 4x4 tables until the result of the gamemode is met. Hope this helps or interests you!
